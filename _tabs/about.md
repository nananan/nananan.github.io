Hi, I'm Eliana. I'm an Italian woman with a strong interest in CyberSecurity. I am OSCP certified and I despair myself with CTF.
I love rubber ducks and, at the moment, I own four of them. Just take a look at how adorable they are!

The red rubber duck was missing a hat, so I decided to remedy the situation by purchasing a cute Christmas hat for it! It didn't seem fair that it was the only one without a hat &#128528; (Considering my love for Christmas, it seemed like the perfect choice!)
