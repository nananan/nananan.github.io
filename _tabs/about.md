Hi, I'm Eliana. I'm an Italian woman interested in CyberSec. I am OSCP certified and I despair myself with CTF.
I love rubber ducks and right now, I got 4 of them, look how they are cute!

The red one didn't have a hat so I bought one for it! It was not fair that it was the only without a hat &#128528;
(I love also Christmas so what better than a Christmas hat?)

If you want to know more about me, you can take a look at my [Linkedin profile](https://it.linkedin.com/in/cannella-eliana?trk=profile-badge).
